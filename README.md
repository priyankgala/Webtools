# Project description
1.	Priyav umbrella's application is an e-commerce website for an umbrella manufacturing company.It enables the customers to view the companies different products, compare their prices and add products in the cart and submit the order.
2.	To make my application more intereactive, I had implemented some feature like javaMail using STMP, Bcrypt for password encryption, proper session management using filters and interceptors to avoid all kinds of SQL and Script injecttion and also iText for PDF generation.
3.	This application has mainly 2 roles - 
•	admin: Who can view the product stock available, add the products, update product and delete the product.
•	customer: who can view the product, compare with other products, add the desirable number in the cart and submit his/her order.
•	guest: user who can view and compare the products but cannot add to the cart or buy the product 
4.	The project utilized JavaScript, jQuery, Bootstrap, CSS and some online templating for screens. The front-end was designed to be user-friendly with proper display messages and alerts. front-end was kept to a minimum since the main goal of the project was to be able to understand the MVC framework and get hands-on experience with to access database objects using Hibernate.
